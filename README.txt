For this edition of the Microgame, I added background song, corruption, from the Incompetech website, along with a banana and cherries from the food props asset pack made by Unity. I changed the shooting and reloading sounds for the main weapon with the gun reload sound from Goldeneye 64, with the gunshot coming from the YT Youtube Channel.
